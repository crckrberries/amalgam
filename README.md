# amalgam

this is another very specific tool i made for something that i will realistically only need to do once and never again

and instead of using a bash one-liner i decided to write this

## Usage

`amalgam [pattern] [path]`

with pattern being a regex(p) pattern and path being the directory you want to coalesce in excruciating pain

the program spits out a file called "amalgam.txt" in the directory you ran it in

many files were harmed in the making of this software
